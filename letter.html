<p>Dear Mr Gray, <br>

I would like to be considered for the prefect role as I believe that I meet the requirements - I <br>have good attendance and punctuality and have no serious consequences. Generally, I get <br>on well with most people; I have many friends who are from different backgrounds and <br>cultures. I enjoy helping people, and my confidence regarding social interactions has greatly <br>improved over the time I have been at Sandringham.
Thank you.<br><br>

Kind Regards,<br>
Ilian Kalvin-Honeywill
